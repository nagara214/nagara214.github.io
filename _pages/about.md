<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My current research interests are **multimodal learning** and **large-scale models** (foundation models, large language models). I focus on computer vision, vision-language understanding, optimization for deep networks, and model robustness.
